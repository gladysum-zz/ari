# ARI (Academic Research Interface)

### WINNER OF 2017 GOVTECH PRIZE AT ANGELHACK NYC

ARI is a research application for government intelligence analysts, scholars, and students. It lets you  research a topic from three different perspectives by entering your search term and selecting from different data source options: IBM Watson Discovery News for the journalistic perspective, Core for the scholarly perspective, and Google Edu and Gov for the perspective of elite educational and government institutions. 

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the GovTech Alliance's "Technologies to Counter Extremism" challenge. Our idea was to create a technological solution to the problem of combatting violent extremism. ARI contributes to this goal by helping key stakeholders understand a complex problem from different angles.
